### Why the project is needed

Katsuna has been designed from the ground up to specifically address the needs of users on the age 60+ where there is an observed decline in physical and cognitive characteristics.
We believe the smartphone experience of these users should be tailored to their needs and we aim to offer the best smartphone experience for seniors.

The projects deal with the main challenges seniors have with smartphones:
- Interaction Complexity
- Adapting to smartphone usage requires time and effort
- User characteristics are not considered

If you like our work give us a Github star.

## How to install?
To install the Katsuna OS on selected devices follow the below instructions:
https://katsuna.com/rom/supported-devices/rom-installation-guide/
 
The Katsuna OS is currently supported on limited Google devices (6P, 5X, Pixel 2xl). We would like to keep supporting only devices from manufacturers that offer the Kernel, drivers and device tree to the community. We hope that in the future we might get to the position to ship the Katsuna OS out of the box after collaboration with OEMs.
 
## Contributing

We need all the meaningful help we can get. If you want to help seniors to have a better smartphone experience designed and developed for their needs. Contact us at info@katsuna.com

Everyone who would like to contribute will go through a short onboarding process to understand the project history and the various needs.

## Limitations
The project is still based on Android 8.1 as we have not rebased our software to newer versions due to resource constraints. Our goal was to be 3 months behind the latest Android version and this has been achieved until the freeze of the project.
A Google Smartphone (Pixel 2xl and newer) is necessary if you are developing on top of AOSP: We will stick to supporting devices that offer the possibility of full customization in a legal way (without using proprietary software). Unfortunately we are not in position to give these devices to contributors, they will have to purchase them by themselves. We are open to supporting other devices from manufacturers that let developers ship a custom ROM without using proprietary code. The number of devices supported is limited and we need to work on this.
